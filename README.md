# Project

ShipItOut is my full stack NSS C46 capstone project. It is related to my initial project, [PackItUp](https://github.com/CheoR/pack-it-up) - track what you pack, app.

ShipItOut consist of React front-end and Django backend.

It is a dashboard-like app that tracks shipping containers where the shipper, container, port authorities can update the container status as it moves.

## Motivation

I come from the transportation/logistics/freight shipping industries and often times the tools we used to track maintenace/inventory/shipments were clunky and outdated.

This is a simple version of something I would wanted to use.
